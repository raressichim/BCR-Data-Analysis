# BCR-Data-Analysis
Machine learning project
My apprenticeship project at BCR involved analyzing a bank registration dataset to identify clients at risk of churning. I used machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost, preprocessed the data, and created insightful visualizations using Python, Anaconda, and Jupyter Notebook.
